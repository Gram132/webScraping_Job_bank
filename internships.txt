Dear Hiring Manager,

I hope this message finds you well.

I recently submitted my application through your platform for the internship post titled {Job_Title}. I am excited about this opportunity as it closely aligns with my skills and experiences.

As a graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Business Intelligence and Statistics, I have a solid foundation in development , data management and analysis. My experience with tools such as Microsoft Office Suite, Python, and Salesforce, combined with my problem-solving abilities, positions me well to contribute effectively to your team. My work on various projects, including a client satisfaction application system, has equipped me with the project management skills necessary to thrive in a fast-paced environment.

I want to mention that I am no longer affiliated with any university, so I am not receiving funding for an Erasmus program. However, I am deeply committed to starting my career and am eager to gain practical experience through an internship or entry-level position. I am willing to work with a lower salary to gain the skills and experience necessary to grow professionally.

I am particularly drawn to your companyâ€™s commitment to innovation and excellence. The opportunity to work in a collaborative environment that values data accuracy and efficiency is very appealing to me. I believe my passion for data analysis and my ability to manage multiple tasks efficiently make me a strong candidate for this role.
